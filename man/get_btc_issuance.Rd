\title{Calculate Bitcoin Daily Issuance Based on Halving Schedule}
\usage{
get_btc_issuance(target_date)
}
\arguments{
\item{target_date}{A date object or character string in "YYYY-MM-DD" format for which
to calculate the daily issuance. The function determines which halving regime was
active on this date.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the estimated number of new Bitcoins mined per day
  on the target date. Returns 0 for dates before the first block (2009-01-03).
}
\description{
Computes the theoretical daily Bitcoin issuance (new coins created) for any given date
based on Bitcoin's predetermined halving schedule. This function models Bitcoin's
monetary policy where block rewards are cut in half approximately every four years.
}
\details{
Bitcoin's issuance follows a strict, predetermined schedule:
\itemize{
  \item \strong{2009-01-03 to 2012-11-27}: 50 BTC per block × 144 blocks/day = 7,200 BTC/day
  \item \strong{2012-11-28 to 2016-07-08}: 25 BTC per block × 144 blocks/day = 3,600 BTC/day
  \item \strong{2016-07-09 to 2020-05-10}: 12.5 BTC per block × 144 blocks/day = 1,800 BTC/day
  \item \strong{2020-05-11 to 2024-04-19}: 6.25 BTC per block × 144 blocks/day = 900 BTC/day
  \item \strong{2024-04-20 to present}: 3.125 BTC per block × 144 blocks/day = 450 BTC/day
}

The calculation assumes:
\itemize{
  \item Consistent 10-minute block intervals (144 blocks per day)
  \item No variance due to difficulty adjustments or hashrate changes
  \item Perfect adherence to halving schedule (which Bitcoin's protocol enforces)
}
}
\note{
This is a theoretical maximum based on ideal block timing. Actual daily issuance
may vary slightly due to:
\itemize{
  \item Block time variance (not exactly 10 minutes)
  \item Occasional orphaned blocks
  \item Difficulty adjustment periods
}
However, over longer periods, the average converges to this theoretical value.
