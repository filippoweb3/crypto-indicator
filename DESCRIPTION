Description: A systematic framework for analyzing 
    cryptocurrency markets. Integrates five distinct categories of indicators 
    (on-chain, derivatives, macro, volatility, and positioning) into a coherent 
    decision system that generates actionable signals across multiple time 
    horizons (short-term, medium-term, long-term). Includes data acquisition 
    from multiple sources (CoinMarketCap, Binance Futures, FRED, Yahoo Finance, 
    Whale Alert, Google Trends) and provides comprehensive risk assessment with 
    color-coded alerts. Designed for quantitative researchers, portfolio 
    managers, and individual traders seeking data-driven edge in crypto markets.
